## Story Teller

what is the storyteller?
    
I used, google's suggestion maker to make an application that does the
verbal equilvalent of "anthakshari". What it does, is to make a query
on google's suggestions end point, and get the resutls, it randomly
selects one of the responses and randomly selects one of the words in
that to make another query. 

Google's suggestions are made of phrases and words that people used,
an application that scans this domain actually scans the words that
people have used in making their google search. It is a interesting
application for example to see how far it can go before it starts
repeating itself.
